\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work we have shown how support vector machine works with and without constraints relaxation.
For support vector machines with constraints relaxation, we have discussed how to select the regularization parameter $C$ by analyzing the dual variables.
It is worth noting that in this work we explored only linear support vector machine.
The accuracies, especially for the Vertebral Columns Database, can be improved by using the kernel trick \cite{bishop2006pattern}.
This will result in non-linear decision boundaries, which, for some tasks, are more suitable than assuming a linear separability.
